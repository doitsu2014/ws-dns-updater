# Overview

This project is Window Service to get current public ip from ipcify then setup it to Cloudflare DNS.
So why I build this project, because I want to build a home lab, and I want to remote my home lab using `RustDesk`.
My problem is the home ip always change and I need to update the DNS record every time it changes.
